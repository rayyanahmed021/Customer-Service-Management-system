# Customer Service Management system
 An interactive application that manipulates files for archiving and loading data in pure C language and features two distinct interfaces: one for customers and one for employees. Employees operate on an administrative interface to view all the customer complaints and modify customer accounts while customers are privileged to launch complaints and modify account details. This application allows a full-length conversation between customers and employees regarding the issue.
